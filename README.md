# WordPress-Enhanced-Registration-Form
Simple shortcode plugin to add a more robust wordpress registration form to your website.

# Breif History
This plugin began with a tutorial I was following all to realize after completing the tutorial that therew were a tonne of bugs within it. From there through the direction within the comments by others who had the same issue I began further enhancing the form with a confirm email field and a confirm password field as well as addressing the changes noted within the comments and their respective links.

# Current State
As is the form works great registering users however I would like to see this plugin enhanced with a proper user email activation element as opposed to them automatically being able to sign into the site. I have began adding this to the project and hope that with some community support we can all have a great functional plugin to use.
